  <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
    The MSBA Case Competition challenged us to design and launch a new digital 
    platform tailored for USC Marshall students. Our proposed app, 
    <strong> USChallengers</strong>, helps students build consistent personal and 
    professional habits by combining <em>gamification, accountability, and 
    community support</em>.

    Many graduate students struggle with sustaining growth-oriented goals amid 
    the demands of classes, recruiting, and personal commitments. Surveys show 
    that over <strong>70% of students fail to maintain their goals beyond one week</strong>. 
    This highlights a clear need for tools that make progress visible, foster 
    peer accountability, and turn habit-building into an engaging experience. 
  </p>
  <p className="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Our mission is to empower students with a supportive ecosystem where 
    <strong>success is a shared journey</strong>â€”transforming short-term challenges into 
    long-term growth.
